It is written in a clear and concise language that makes it easy to follow and understand. It is also updated with the latest developments and applications of calculus in various fields of science and technology.
  
Samuel Fuenlabrada was born in Mexico City in 1948. He studied mathematics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and obtained his master's degree in 1974. He then became a professor of mathematics at the same university and taught courses on calculus, linear algebra, differential equations and numerical analysis. He also participated in several research projects and published papers on mathematical modeling, optimization and numerical methods.
 
In addition to his academic career, Samuel Fuenlabrada has been involved in various educational initiatives and projects. He has written more than 20 books on mathematics for different levels of education, from elementary school to university. He has also collaborated with the Ministry of Education of Mexico and other institutions to design and implement curricula and textbooks for mathematics education. He has received several awards and recognitions for his contributions to mathematics and education, such as the National Prize for Science and Arts in 2010.
 
Samuel Fuenlabrada is one of the most influential and respected mathematicians and educators in Mexico and Latin America. His books on calculus have been widely used by students and teachers for decades. His work has helped to promote and improve the teaching and learning of mathematics in his country and beyond.
  
One of the main goals of Samuel Fuenlabrada is to make mathematics accessible and enjoyable for everyone. He believes that mathematics is not only a tool for science and technology, but also a form of art and culture. He has said: "Mathematics is a language that allows us to express ourselves in a precise and elegant way. It is also a way of thinking that helps us to discover and understand the patterns and structures that exist in nature and in our own minds."

He has also emphasized the importance of developing mathematical intuition and creativity, rather than memorizing formulas and procedures. He has said: "Mathematics is not a collection of rules and facts that we have to learn by heart. It is a living and dynamic discipline that evolves and grows with the contributions of many people. It is also a creative activity that requires imagination and curiosity."
 
Samuel Fuenlabrada's books on calculus reflect his vision and passion for mathematics. They are not only informative and rigorous, but also engaging and inspiring. They invite the reader to explore and discover the beauty and power of calculus, as well as its applications and relevance in various fields of knowledge.
