3. To add a new source database, click on the `New Source` button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can select the database format and enter the connection details. For Access, you can browse for the database file (.mdb or .accdb) on your computer or network. Click on `Test Connection` to verify that the software can access your source database.
4. To add a new target database, click on the `New Target` button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can select the database format and enter the connection details.

5. Once you have added both source and target databases, you can see them in the project tree. You can expand each node to see the tables, views, and other objects in each database. You can also right-click on any node to access various options, such as renaming, deleting, copying, or editing.
6. To start the migration process, click on the `Run` button on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can review and modify the migration settings, such as whether to drop existing objects, create indexes, copy data, etc. You can also select which objects to migrate by checking or unchecking them in the project tree. Click on `Start` to begin the migration.
7. The software will display a progress bar and a log window that shows the status and details of each migration step. You can pause or cancel the migration at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons. You can also save the log file for future reference.
8. When the migration is completed, you will see a message box that shows the summary and statistics of the migration. You can click on `OK` to close it. You can then check your target database to verify that your data has been migrated successfully.
