In this section, we will show you how to use Rizom-Lab RizomUV Real and Virtual Spaces 2018.0.100 Win to create UV maps for a simple 3D model. We will use a cube as an example, but you can apply the same steps to any model you want.
 
First, you need to load your model into the software. You can do this by clicking on the File menu and choosing Import Mesh. You can also drag and drop your file into the viewport. The software supports various file formats, such as OBJ, FBX, STL and PLY.
 
Once your model is loaded, you will see it in the 3D viewport on the left side of the screen. On the right side, you will see the 2D viewport, where you can view and edit your UVs. At the bottom of the screen, you will see the toolbar, where you can access various tools and options.
 
To create UVs for your model, you need to define seams on your model. Seams are edges that separate different parts of your model. You can think of them as cuts that allow you to unfold your model into a flat surface.
 
To create seams, you can use the Cut tool from the toolbar. You can select edges by clicking on them or by using the selection modes from the top menu. You can also use the AutoSeams tool to automatically generate seams based on the angle between faces.
 
When you have created seams on your model, you can use the Unwrap tool to unwrap your model into UVs. You can choose between different unwrapping methods, such as Angle Based, Conformal or ABF++. You can also adjust some parameters, such as stretch tolerance and island spacing.
 
After unwrapping your model, you will see your UVs in the 2D viewport. You can use the Pack tool to arrange your UVs in a compact and efficient way. You can also use the Edit tool to move, rotate, scale and transform your UVs. You can also use the Align tool to align your UVs along axes or boundaries.
 
To optimize your UVs, you can use the Optimize tool to reduce distortion and improve area preservation. You can also use the feedback colors to visualize the quality of your UVs. The feedback colors show you how much your UVs are stretched, skewed or distorted compared to your model.
 
When you are satisfied with your UVs, you can export them to a file or copy them to the clipboard. You can also export a texture map that shows your UV layout on a grid. You can use this texture map as a reference for painting or baking textures in other software.
 
Rizom-Lab RizomUV Real and Virtual Spaces 2018.0.100 Win makes it easy and fast to create UV maps for your 3D models. You can use its powerful tools and features to unwrap, pack, edit and optimize your UVs with precision and flexibility.
